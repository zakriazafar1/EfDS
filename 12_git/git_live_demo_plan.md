## Demo plan

- Initialize empty git repository:
  - Create a new directory
  - Initialize the new repository inside that directory (use Ctrl-Shift-P, function `git init`)
- Create the first files of the project:
  - Create `Vec.py`, create `test.py`; `__init__` method, `__repr__` method
  - Run `test.py` for the first time and make it work. Note: it will create a cache file
- Go to the CHANGES tab:
  - discuss meaning of the file status letters
  - discuss ADD (+), COMMIT
  - commit `Vec.py`, `test.py`; do not commit the cache file
- Add methods `x()` and `y()` to `Vec.py`, and test them in `test.py`:
  - discuss the meaning of green/blue bars and red ticks in the editor
  - discuss the popup window with the diff info
  - discuss when to add the next commit (consistent state)
  - commit `Vec.py`, `test.py`
- `.gitignore`:
  - in changes discuss the as-list/as-tree button
  - discuss the `__pychache__` folder
  - add `__pycache__` to the `.gitignore` file
  - show and discuss the `.gitignore` file
  - add `.gitignore` to the commit
- `MulAddTrial` branch:
  - let's start adding new methods: `add()` and `mul()`, but incompletely
  - since the files are not finished, we don't want to commit them to the main branch
  - the code does not work yet, for example because of `:Vec` type specification
  - in changes, let's stage the changes
  - let's pretend to think about the changes -> unstage the changes
  - discuss the visualization of the staged changes in the editor tab
  - create a new branch `MulAddTest`
  - commit the changes to the new branch
  - discuss the branch ids in the graph tab
- `main` branch:
  - prepare editor to visualize that the working directory files will change
  - discuss the Auto/All branch tree visualization switch in GRAPH tab
  - do checkout to switch to the main branch
  - add docstrings to the Vec class
  - before committing discuss where the commit will get attached (`HEAD`)
  - commit the changes to main
  - discuss the commit graph (`HEAD`, `main`, `AddMulTrial`)
  - discuss what happens with the branch tag when we add a new commit
- Play with switching branches:
  - show switching branches in the graph tab and in the editor
  - show how the `HEAD` tag switches in the graph tab
  - discuss the branch names (detached `HEAD`)
- `MulAddTrial` branch:
  - discuss from typing `import Self`
  - show that the code runs
  - inspect the changes when clicking inside the CHANGES tab
  - commit the changes
- `main` branch, merge in `MulAddTrial` branch:
  - Switch to the branch into which we want to merge
  - Mouse over CHANGES tab title to see the MERGE button
  - Merge the `MulAddTrial` branch into the main branch
  - Discuss the GRAPH tab and the merge commit
  - Click on the merge commit to see the changes
- `main` branch:
  - Add missing docstrings to the `Vec` class
  - Commit the changes
- `AngleTrial` branch (adding angles functionality):
  - Let's pretend this is done on another computer, therefore the branch
  - Add `angle()` method
  - Extend the `__repr__` method -> this will kill one test
  - Commit to a new branch `AngleTrial`
- `main` branch:
  - Checkout to the main branch
  - Add `length()` method
  - Add test of `Vec(3,4).length() == 5`
  - Code/test works -> commit the changes to the main branch
- `AngleTrial` branch:
  - Checkout to the AngleTrial branch
  - Correct the `__repr__` method
  - Add tests Vec(0,1).angle() == pi/2...
  - Commit the changes to the AngleTrial branch
- `main` branch merge `AngleTrial` branch (CONFILCT):
  - Repeat: the main branch is the one into which we want to merge
  - Repeat: the main branch is the one which should always be stable
  - Checkout to the main branch
  - In the EXPLORER tab, right click `Vec.py` and select Open Changes with Branch
  - Select the parallel view (not inline)
  - Discuss the changes, discuss where the conflict will arise
  - Do the merge
- `main` branch:
  - explain the grayed files in the explorer tab
  - correct gitignore to ignore the cache dir
- Attaching to a newly created GitHub repo:
  - In GitHub create a new repository (private; empty: no `README.md`, no `.gitignore`, etc.)
  - In CHANGES/Remote choose add new remote
  - Use the (ssh) URL of the GitHub repository; use `origin` as the remote name
  - Push to the GitHub repo; observe new content
  - Observe the cloud symbol on the repository graph
  - Explain "push request" concept
