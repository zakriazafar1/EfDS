    "# Challenge: Neural network regressor to predict photometric redshifts\n",
    "In observational astronomy, measuring the redshift of a galaxy tells us how far away it is, and thus provides crucial information about the structure and evolution of the universe.\n",
    "\n",
    "Traditionally, redshifts are measured using spectroscopy, which provides highly accurate values but is expensive and time-consuming — suitable only for a limited number of objects.\n",
    "\n",
    "To overcome this, astronomers often use photometric redshifts (photo-z): estimates of a galaxy’s redshift derived from its brightness (magnitude) in a few broad photometric bands (e.g., ugriz, JHK). These estimates are much faster to obtain, but less precise.\n",
    "\n",
    "Goal: Build a supervised regression model that predicts the redshift of galaxies from their photometric features using a neural network. Use the spectroscopic redshift 'z' as your label for the supervision of the model."
